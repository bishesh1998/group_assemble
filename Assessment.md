### Final Project Readme.md File along  with the Final Project Due Thu Dec 17th at the final
Your group will submit a Readme.md file along with your with all the code for your project to your shared Whitgit final project repository. This Readme.md file will contain
- [x] The title of your final project program.
- [x] A short description of the purpose and goals of the program. 
- [x] How to run the program.
- [x] What assumptions did you make when working on the project (e.g. knowledge level of users, etc.)?
- [x] A detailed description of how your code works. Cite key variables,  functions, (and possibly objects). Specify how they interact with each other.
- [x]  __Works Cited__ This should includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should also be listed directly in your code.


### Final Presentation and Analysis 
During the final time for your section, your group will give a presentation on the work that you accomplished. 
- [ ] Algorithm works.
- [ ] You must present an __algorithm analysis__ of the worst case run time for your algorithm and compare this analytical runtime to the actual empirical runtime results (use period doubling method).

### Individual Project Reflection
The project reflections are graded individually.
