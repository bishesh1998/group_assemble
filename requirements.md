# Final Project
Class: CS 473 - Advanced Algorithms 
Last Modified: 11/22/2020

## Overview
The goal of the final project is to give you a chance to explore and apply an advanced algorithm to a real world problem. Advanced algorithm analysis forms much of the theoretical foundation of computer science.  Rather than give a final exam, we would rather see you use your analytical and critical thinking abilities expressed towards accomplishing a goal of a producing a software product that implements something you are interested in. This document will outline the minimum basic expectations for the project and how you should implement and deliver that project, but you are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond the minimum expectations. Work that goes above and beyond may earn extra credit.

### General Requirements
Overall this will be 30% of your total grade for this class.  
* As a group you must choose and implement an advanced algorithm and apply it to a real world problem.
* You must compare the practical, actual efficiency of the algorithm to the theoretical efficiency you computed (use the doubling method we discussed in class).
* Your group must also prepare a group project presentation and present it to the class during the final exam period.
* You are highly encouraged (but not required) to find a __real world__ client with a practical problem that actually needs solving. IMPORTANT: If you think you might like whitworth as a client, please discuss this with me and not computing services. I will represent Whitworth in for these projects.
* You may either design a new algorithm of your own choosing or you may pick an algorithm from the literature.
* You can still do very well without an actual client, however, those groups that show creativity, initiative, and effort beyond the requirements of this course will benefit. (Both in terms of resume material, and in terms of grade for this course).   

### Group Project Structure and Professionalism
You will be assigned a group for this final project. Thus professional conduct when interacting with others will be important. If there are specific reason you cannot particpate in a group, you will be given a chance to state this when we collect group preference data for assigning the groups.

Desirable group behaviors are:
* Following through on scheduled meetings (or texting/emailing if there is an emergency and a meeting can't be attended on time)
* Practicing good listening skills and diplomacy when discussing issues or problems with the code. Instead of pointing blame, focus on fixing issues.
* Treating your group partner(s) the way you wish to be treated. 

In addition, since this project will be completed as a group, all code will be written utilizing pair programming, this means that:
* All group members will be present and actively engaged (e.g. using Live Share and Discord)  when working on the code together. 
* The rest of the work should be evenly divided among the group members and all group members should review all work before submitting it.
* The development of the documentation preferably should be done as a pair, but this is not required.
* Reliability in attending meetings and participation will all be a part of your final grade for this project. 
  
All documents, with the exception of the individual feedback sent via email, will be submitted via Whitgit. You and your partner have access to a group project folder. The submission closest to, but not past the start of the final presentations for your section will be graded.

### Project Description and Ideas
You must not simply follow an online tutorial or submit an existing project found online as your own code. You may look at resources for ideas, you may use other libraries, but, the main design and coding should be original work, thought up, and created by the group as a whole. Here are some ideas

* Non Profit Delivery Application: Use a map interface to select delivery points. Compute the optimal route to those points.
* Other application for a client of your choosing that requires an efficient optimization algorithm.
* Optimization algorithm with easy to use interface for delivery of students on C.B.D.
* Bioinformatics algorithm implementation - (many possibilities here: alignment, DNA assembly, etc.).
* Computational Geometry: Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, etc. algorithm implementation.
* Boolean satisfiability algorithm â€“ write a SAT solver describe how it works compare it to other SAT solvers
* Numerical Analysis Algorithms (iterative row improvement, etc.)
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm implemenation. Use your algorithm to find the frequency decomposition of actual sound clips.
* Other selected advanced algorithms topics or clients of your choice that were not covered in class.

### Deliverable #1: Project Proposal Due Mon Nov 30th 
I highly encourage each group to make a short project proposal to your instructor before you proceed. You don't want to be that group which at presentation time their project was not sufficient!  Take the time to communicate with your instructor and determine if the level of difficulty is acceptable. Write up the project paragraph. Discuss this with your instructor before or on Nov 30th. This can eventually become a part of your projects Readme.md file.

### Deliverable #2: Final Project Readme.md File along  with the Final Project Due Thu Dec 17th at the final
Your group will submit a Readme.md file along with your with all the code for your project to your shared Whitgit final project repository. This Readme.md file will contain
* The title of your final project program.
* A short description of the purpose and goals of the program. 
* How to run the program.
* What assumptions did you make when working on the project (e.g. knowledge level of users, etc.)?
* A detailed description of how your code works. Cite key variables,  functions, (and possibly objects). Specify how they interact with each other.
* __Works Cited__ This should includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should also be listed directly in your code.
* This documentation is worth 5% of your over all grade, make it representative of that weight. A single page likely will not be detailed enough.
* Your code must be appropriately commented. This includes headers for every method/function and file headers.

### Deliverable #3: Final Presentation Thu Dec 17th at the final 
During the final time for your section, your group will give a presentation on the work that you accomplished. 

* Your team must give a talk describing your algorithm. Time allotted to each group will be determined by an even division of 2 hours / (# of groups + 1).
* You must demonstrate your algorithm running.
* You must present an __algorithm analysis__ of the worst case run time for your algorithm and compare this analytical runtime to the actual empirical runtime results (use period doubling method).

### Deliverable #4: Individual Project Reflection
In addition each group member will email their instructor on the day of the final presentation an individual and confidential reflection of how the project went (subject line: CS 473 Project Reflection), along with a review of their group member(s) This will be worth 5% of your overall project grade. You should answer the following in this email:

* How did the project go? What went well? What would you do differently?
* How has your team dealt with the remote work aspect? What challenges have you faced and overcome?
* Did you and your team listen well to one another? Did you and your team work to positivly motivate each other? 
* Did you and your team made good team decisions, or did your or other team members make major decisions without first talking to the team as a whole?
* Did you and your team members shown passion/interest/enthusiasm for what you are building?
* What should you and your team keep doing well in the future?
* What improvements can you and your team make in the future to avoid these issues?
* Were your team objectives clear, did you make good progress?
